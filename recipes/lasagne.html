            <h2 class="subsection">Description</h2>
            <p>Pasta, Lasagne and Pizza, the trinity of Italy.</br>Most people will likely eat those dishes on the regular and should know how to cook them as close to perfection as possible.</p>
            <p>To cook Lasagne, or as one of my friends has put it <em>&quot;Spaghetti-Cake&quot;</em> (don't call it that in Italy if you don't want to get haunted by the ghost of someone's nonna), </br> you need a lot of patience but will be rewarded with one of the tastiest dishes on the planet.</br>So pray that you wont offend Italian ancestors by trying this and let's get to it!</em></p>

            <h2 class="subsection">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ragout Bolognese</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large casserole, melt the chopped or diced panecetta with the olive oil.</li>
                        <li>Slowly saute the finely chopped vegetables over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon (be sure not to brown the onion much).</li>
                        <li>Increase the heat, add the minced meat and fry, stirring thoroughly, until sizzling, about ten minutes.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the wine, let it evaporate completely until it no longer smells of wine.</li>
                        <li>Add tomato paste and tomato puree.</li>
                        <li>
                            While stirring constantly, add a cup of boiling broth (or even water) and simmer slowly, covered, for about 2 hours (or 3 hours, depending on preference and meat used), adding hot broth as needed.</br>
                            Note: the longer you cook it at low heat the tastier it becomes. I had this thing cooking for over 8 hours once and it tasted amazing!
                        </li>
                        <li>Halfway through the cooking time, according to tradition, you can add the milk, which must be boil down completely.</li>
                        <li>At the end of the cooking time, season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sauce Bechamel</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a casserole, melt the butter over low heat.</li>
                        <li>Slowly add the flour, stirring with a wooden spoon. This mixture is called <em>Roux</em></li>
                        <li>Let the mixture brown carefully watching not to burn it.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile heat the milk.</li>
                        <li>Add the milk slowly to the roux, stirring vigorously with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
                        <li>Turn up the heat to medium. While stirring constantly let the sauce thicken up.</li>
                        <li>Add salt, nutmeg and optionally pepper and Parmigiano reggiano to the sauce.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Coat a casserole with the olive oil and add the first layer of Ragout.</li>
                <li>Cover with lasagne pasta sheets and add a layer Ragout and Sauce Bechamel.</li>
                <li>Repeat the last step until you run out of sauce or room in your casserole.</li>
                <li>Add a generous amount of Mozzarella and Parmegiano reggiano cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the oven at 180 degrees C (350 degree F) until golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
