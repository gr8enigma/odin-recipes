        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What better summer dish than a nice crunchy salad with fresh veggies from the garden?</p>
        <p>You really can throw anything in these. I usually do and it turns out great. </br> Salads are super healthy and great way to get in shape too. What's not to like?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce (pick any type you want)</li>
            <li>Veggies (go wild here too, everything goes as long as it can be eaten raw and does not poison you)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Parmegiano reggiano (optional) for garnishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
             <li>Under cold water wash the lettuce (and preferable the veggies too).</li>
             <li>Rinse the lettuce thoroughly. A salad spinner works great for getting most of the water out.</li>
             <li>Cut the vegetables in bite sized pieces and add the pieces with the lettuce in a big bowl.</li>
             <li>Whisk together oil, vinegar, salt and pepper until creamy. This is called <em>Vinaigrette</em></li>
             <li>Mix everything together in the big bowl and optionally garnish with Parmesan shavings.</li>
             <li>Enjoy getting healthier.</li>
        </ol>
